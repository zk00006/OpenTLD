Installation 
============

1. Windows
	Tested on: Matlab R2010a, VS2010, Windows 7 (32-bit, 64-bit), OpenCV2.2
	1.1 Install OpenCV
	    a) make sure to compile opencv 
	    b) make sure that system variable PATH includes the directory to the OpenCV DLLs 
	1.2 Check paths in 'compile.m' file
	1.3 run 'compile.m', if you get errors go to OpenTLD discussion group
	1.4 run 'run_TLD.m', TLD should track a motorbike
 
2. Mac
   ...

3. Linux
	1.1 Install OpenCV
		sudo apt-get install libcv-dev (this will most probably be 2.1)
	1.2a Install Matlab (>= R2009b). Possibly you will need some extension toolboxes (which?)
	1.2b There are efforts underway to make TLD work with Octave, an open source alternative to Matlab
		You will need to install octave >=3.4.
		Also, install octave extension packages miscellaneous, image, statistics from http://octave.sourceforge.net/packages.php
    1.3 Check paths in 'compile.m' file
    1.4 run 'compile.m', (either in matlab or octave). If you get errors go to OpenTLD discussion group
    1.5 run 'run_TLD.m', TLD should track a motorbike
