TLD (aka Predator)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLD is an algorithm for tracking of unknown objects in unconstrained video streams. The object of interest is defined by a bounding box in a single frame. TLD simultaneously tracks the object, learns its appearance and detects it whenever it appears in the video.

You can find more information about TLD at: http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/Z.Kalal/tld.html. This includes the description of TLD, links to research papers, posters and the licensing options.

3. Wiki

Many questions regarding TLD are already answered at the following wiki: https://github.com/zk00006/OpenTLD/wiki. These questions include installation and common errors. Make sure to check the wiki first.

4. Discussion group

If you do not find your answer in the wiki, ask the question directly at the following discussion group:  http://groups.google.com/group/opentld. There are currently around 250 participants and it is likely you will get the answer soon.  

5. Feedback

Predator learns from its errors; let us do the same in this community! Therefore, if you get an answer that was not covered in the wiki, please update the wiki so that other people do not have to face the same problem. The wiki is freely editable at the moment.

Installation 
============

1. Windows
	Tested on: Matlab R2010a, VS2010, Windows 7 (32-bit, 64-bit), OpenCV2.2
	1.1 Install OpenCV
	    a) make sure to compile opencv 
	    b) make sure that system variable PATH includes the directory to the OpenCV DLLs 
	1.2 Check paths in 'compile.m' file
	1.3 run 'compile.m', if you get errors go to OpenTLD discussion group
	1.4 run 'run_TLD.m', TLD should track a motorbike
 
2. Mac
   ...

3. Linux
	1.1 Install OpenCV
		sudo apt-get install libcv-dev (this will most probably be 2.1)
	1.2a Install Matlab (>= R2009b). Possibly you will need some extension toolboxes
            include:
                Image Acquisition Toolbox
                Image Processing Toolbox
                Signal Processing Toolbox
                Statistics Toolbox
	1.2b There are efforts underway to make TLD work with Octave, an open source alternative to Matlab
		You will need to install octave >=3.4.
		Also, install octave extension packages miscellaneous, image, statistics from http://octave.sourceforge.net/packages.php
    1.3 Check paths in 'compile.m' file
    1.4 run 'compile.m', (either in matlab or octave). If you get errors go to OpenTLD discussion group
    1.5 run 'run_TLD.m', TLD should track a motorbike
